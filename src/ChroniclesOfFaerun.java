 * PROGRAM PURPOSE: Chronicles of Faerun is a text-based RPG in the Forgotten Realms that captures the
 *         original campaign produced by Larian Studios and textually adds more content for the user to interact with.
 *         Some new features are additional dialogue options with certain characters, new items, areas, and choices for
 *         the main character to decide at critical plot points during the campaign. The file will open to an
 *         introductory message and title screen, and then prompt the user with the following choices,
 *         'Continue', 'New Game', 'Load Game', and 'Quit'. The user can then make their choice to continue their
 *         existing campaign, create a new campaign, load their preferred existing campaign, or quit the application.
